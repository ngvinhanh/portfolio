                    <p>Hello, my name is Vinh Anh and I'm a web developer from Paris.</p>
                    <p>I enjoy working as a front-end web developer and building aesthetically pleasing yet intuitive and functional websites.</p>
                    <p>My guiding principle is that if there's something I don't understand, it's just because I haven't spent enough time on it. Iâ€™m not afraid of trying hard until I can be proud of my work.</p>
                    <p>I'd love to get to know people with the same perspective on life.</p>
